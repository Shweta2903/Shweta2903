//Examples of Mathematical opretors 

//Addition
let x = 50;
let y = 100;
let z = x + y;
console.log("Result of x + y is :", z);

//Subtraction
let a = 300;
let b = 30;
let c = a - b;
console.log("Result of a - b is :", c);

//Multiplication
let p = 50;
let q = 40;
let r = p * q;
console.log("Result of p * q is :", r);

//Division
let d = 1000;
let e = 50;
let f = d/e;
console.log("Result of d / r is :", f);

//Modulus
let g = 3567;
let h = 20;
let i = g % h;
console.log("Result of g % h is :", i);

//Increment
let j = 1;
j++;
console.log("Value of j is :", j);

//Decrement
let k = 5;
k--;
console.log("value of k is :", k);
